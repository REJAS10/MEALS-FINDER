### Project Description
[A fun website that helps you decide what to eat for breakfast when your brain is still half asleep. Just answer a few questions, and it will give you a random Malabar or Kerala breakfast suggestion with ingredients]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Every Indian household knows the struggle: deciding breakfast is harder than deciding your future career. Confused moms, hungry kids, and endless debates ‚Äî chaos in the kitchen before 9 AM.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[We built a ‚ÄúBreakfast Destiny‚Äù generator! It asks about your preferences, health needs, and pantry items, then magically (and randomly) decides your breakfast for the day. No thinking required ‚Äî just eating.  ]
